# Egg Timer ðŸ¥š

## (Really enjoyed doing this app)
Basically, this is an app where you can get the exact amount of time necesssary to cook an Egg, depending on how you wnat it to be.

## What I learned:

* Swift Collection types - Dictionaries
* The Swift Timer API
* Conditional statements - IF/ELSE
* Conditional statements - Switch
* Functions with outputs
* How to use the ProgressView

## This is a project from the iOS development bootcamp, taught by Angela Yu  :)
